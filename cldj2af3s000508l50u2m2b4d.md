# **What is MERN Stack?** ü§î

It is a collection of technologies and robust that is used to develop scalable master web applications comprising **backend, front-end,** and **database components**. MERN Stack is a JavaScript Stack that is used for easier and faster deployment of full-stack web applications. It is a user-friendly full-stack JavaScript framework for building applications and dynamic websites.

MERN Stack consists of four main components :

1. **M** stands for **MongoDB ( Database ),** used for preparing document databases. It is a NoSQL (Non-Structured Query Language ) Database System.
    
2. **E** stands for **Express,** used for developing Node.js web framework.
    
3. **R** stands for **React,** used for developing a client-side or front-end JavaScript framework.
    
4. **N** stands for **js,** used for developing the premier JavaScript web server.
    

These four technologies play an important role in providing an end-to-end framework for the developers as well as the development process of web applications.

MERN stack was earlier named as MEAN stack, MERN Stack is one of the variations of MEAN.MEAN is also comprised of four components, i.e., M is for MongoDB, ' E ' is for Express, ' A ' is for Angular.js, and ' N ' is for Node. The main reason behind MERN Stack is mainly used for faster development of smaller applications as compared with MEAN, MEAN stack is a better option for larger applications. By the way, it takes more time the development of smaller applications. They also both have different structures comparatively.

We can observe that MEAN relies on **Angular.js** for its front-end JavaScript framework, whereas the MERN stack relies on **React** and **its ecosystem**.

# **Why should we choose MERN Stack for building Mobile and Web applications?** ‚úíÔ∏è

1. **Cost-effective: All** four technologies that are MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) are used in MERN Stack is built on JavaScript making it cost-effective and with less cost investment user will able to get better results or output.
    
2. **SEO friendly:** **SEO** (**Search Engine Optimization**) friendly refers that Google, Yahoo and other search engines can search each page on the website efficiently and easily, interpret and correlate the content effectively with the searched text and easily index it in their database.
    
3. **Better performance:** It provides faster response between the backend and front-end and database, which improves the website speed and gives better performance, thus providing a smooth user experience.
    
4. **Increase Security:** The security of applications generated using MERN; its web application security refers to various processes, methods or technologies used for protecting web servers and various web applications, such as APIs (**Application user interface**) from attack by internet-based threats. Generally, secured hosting providers can easily integrate applications created using the MERN stack. For better security, Mongo DB and Node.js security tools are also used.
    
5. **Faster delivery:** Web applications and mobile applications that are created by using MERN Stack are built much faster, which helps to provide faster delivery to our clients.
    

# **The architecture of the MERN Stack** üõ†Ô∏è

MERN has a 3-tier Architecture system, consisting of 3 layers -

* Web as front-end tier
    
* Server as the middle tier
    
* Database as backend tier
    

1. ### **Web or front-end tier**
    
    The top tier of the MERN stack is handled by React.js. React.js is one of the most prominent used open-source front-end JavaScript libraries used for building Web applications. It is famous for creating **dynamic client-side applications**.
    
2. ### **Server or middle-tier**
    
    It is the second layer of the architecture which is handled by two components, i.e., **Express.js** and **Node.js.** Express.js maintains the Server-side framework, running inside the Node.js server. Express.js is one of the widely used backend development JavaScript Frameworks. It adds helpful functionalities to Node.js HTTP (**HyperText Transfer Protocol**) objects, Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside a browser.
    
3. ### **Database as backend tier**
    
    It is one of the most important levels of the MERN Stack and is handled by MongoDB; the main role of a database is to store all the data related to your application. It mainly stores all the data for **safety purposes**. It maintains a proper record that returns the data to the user whenever required. It generates two or more replica files of the data so that whenever the system fails, it can retrieve the exact information or data that the user wanted earlier. It implies that MongoDB is not based on the table-like relational database structure. **Mongo DB** is the most popular NoSQL (NoSQL or Non-Structured Query Language) database, an open-source document-oriented database.
    

# **Major Components of MERN Stack** üìÅ

Let us understand one by one the four technologies or components that play a major role in forming MERN Stack:

### **MongoDB**

* **Mongo DB** is the most popular NoSQL (NoSQL or Non-Structured Query Language) database, an open-source document-oriented database.
    
* The storage format in which the data is stored is known as BSON, which stands for Binary JavaScript Object Notation; its binary structure encodes length and type of information, which allows it to be parsed much more quickly.
    
* MongoDB uses BSON when storing documents in collections.
    
* It is Schemaless; each data stored is stored in a separate document.
    

### **Express**

* Express is a JavaScript server-side framework that runs within **js**.
    
* It provides the developer with a platform to create and maintain robust servers.
    
* Express is used for building and designing web and mobile applications easily and quickly.
    
* It allows developers to spin up robust APIs (**Application Programming Interfaces**) and web servers.
    

### **React**

* React is one of the most popular open-source front-end JavaScript libraries used for building Web applications.
    
* Before using react, it has some prerequisites that one should follow, that you must download Node packages in your system with their latest versions. Also, you must understand HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
    
* It is used to build user interfaces, especially for a single-page web application.
    
* It allows us to create reusable UI ( User Interface ) components.
    
* It was first created by software engineer Jordan Walke, who works for Facebook.
    
* It allows developers to create large web applications that can easily change the data of the page even without reloading the page.
    
* There are a lot of open-source platforms that are also used to make the front-end web and mobile applications easier, like Angular js in MVC, but still, React replaces Angular from the MEAN stack. Now, most developers are using the MERN stack in which react is used; the main reason is that it is very fast and has more advantages over other front-end frameworks.
    
    ### **Node.js**
    
* js is an open-source cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside a browser.
    
* It is used for building and developing the backend of web applications like net applications, and mobile applications.
    
* Massive corporations principally utilize it in production like **Uber, PayPal, Netflix,**
    
* It will run on numerous operative systems like **Windows, Mac, Linux, Unix**, etc.
    
* It is incredibly simple to urge started with it and may even be used for agile development and prototyping.
    
* It provides extremely ascendable and quick services to the users.
    
* It contains a Non-blocking or, can say, Asynchronous nature.
    

# **Advantages of MERN Stack** üîñ

Now we will read some advantages of the MERN Stack-

1. It covers all the web development stages starting from front-end development to backend development with JavaScript.
    
2. It is an open-source framework mainly used to develop web-based or mobile applications and is supported by the community.
    
3. Very fast and efficient compared to MEAN Stack and is mostly suitable for small applications, whereas MEAN Stack is suitable for developing large applications.
