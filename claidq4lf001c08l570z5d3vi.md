Are you considering a career in data science? You will need the following essential data science abilities in order to change careers. There are suggestions and resources on how to develop each of the data science skills listed, as well. This is not a comprehensive list; rather, it is aimed to provide you a general idea of what you will need to succeed as a data scientist.

As the need for data scientists grows, the field offers both aspiring professionals and seasoned workers an alluring career path. This includes people who aren't data scientists but are captivated with data and the field, leading them to wonder what big data and data science abilities are required to seek careers in the field.

Data scientists are in high demand at the enterprise level across all industry verticals due to the usage of Big Data as an insight-generating engine. Organizations are increasingly relying on data scientist abilities to sustain, expand, and stay one step ahead of the competition, whether it's to enhance customer retention, streamline the product development process, or mine data to uncover new business prospects.


**1. Problem solving intuition**

Being good at problem solving is very important to being a good data scientist. As a practicing data scientist, you don't just need to know how to solve a problem that's defined for you, but also how to find and define those problems in the first place. It starts with becoming comfortable with not knowing the exact steps you will need to take to solve a problem.

Data science is a complex industry, that is also characterized by the combination of many complex tasks. Moreover, because most data scientists are employed by businesses and not research institutions, the need to make decisions quickly is a requirement for building successful solutions. Therefore, I argue that developing expert intuition and learning how to use it to inform decision making can help data scientists become better data scientists.


**2. Statistical knowledge
**

Data science is an interdisciplinary subject of research with many facets. It doesn't simply rule the digital sphere. Internet searches, social media feeds, political campaigns, stocking grocery stores, choosing airline routes, scheduling doctor's appointments, and other fundamental tasks all depend on it. It's all over. What is data science so relevant to everyday life? One of the most crucial fields for data scientists is statistics, among others.

When working in data science, the math and statistics applied can often be obscured by the fact that you're just writing code or using functions. The better you understand that underlying process, the better you'll be at using it. For example, you must be able to understand when variations in the data are statistically significant so that you can make bigger assumptions and conclusions about what’s going on. There is so much to learn in this realm and the more knowledge you have, the more accurate conclusions you will be able to draw from a given dataset.



**3. Programming in an analytic language (R or Python)**

Knowing a programming language is essential in order to become a data scientist. Programming allows you to take vast amounts of data and process them quickly in a meaningful way. You’ll also be able to use programming to do things like scrape websites for data or use APIs. Right now some of the most popular languages for data science analytics include Python or R.


**4. Curiosity (keep asking why)**

Not only will curiosity keep you driven to continue your learning in the long run, but it will also help you know what questions to ask when you are diving into a new set of data. Your first answer is rarely the right one. If you keep diving deeper you may find things that surprise you, or change your whole understanding of the problem!

Data analysis and curiosity may seem like an odd couple. How do these two relate to one another and do they complement one another, if at all?

Data analysis can initially appear to be very mathematical and scientific. Number crunching, inflexible dashboards, and complicated calculations come to mind. The key to being a great analyst, though, is to use curiosity by consistently posing questions, expanding your knowledge, and challenging assumptions.

Being inquisitive in life has many benefits, but it's crucial to strike a balance so you can know when to stop learning and start acting. Processes can occasionally be slowed down by unbridled curiosity and the urge to consider all options. This is why it's important to recognize and distinguish between circumstances in which applying deeply creative thinking is appropriate.
