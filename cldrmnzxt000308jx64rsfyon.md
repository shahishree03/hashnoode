Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. It is a very popular language used by developers. Python programming language is used in web development, Machine Learning applications, and many more. Python Programming Language is very well suited for Beginners, also for experienced programmers with other programming languages like C++ and Java.

### **Python History**

Python was invented by **Guido van Rossum** in 1991 at CWI in Netherland. The idea of Python programming language has taken from the ABC programming language or we can say that ABC is a predecessor of Python language.

There is also a fact behind the choosing name Python. Guido van Rossum was a fan of the popular BBC comedy show of that time, **"Monty Python's Flying Circus"**. So he decided to pick the name **Python** for his newly created programming language.

Here are some interesting  facts about Python Programming Language:

1. Python is currently the most widely used multi-purpose, high-level programming language.
    
2. Python allows programming in Object-Oriented and Procedural paradigms.
    
3. Python programs generally are smaller than other programming languages like Java. Programmers have to type relatively less and the indentation requirement of the language makes them readable all the time.
    
4. Python language is being used by almost all tech-giant companies like – Google, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox, Uber… etc.
    
5. The biggest strength of Python is its huge collection of standard libraries which can be used for the following:
    
    * Machine Learning
        
    * GUI Applications (like Kivy, Tkinter, PyQt etc. )
        
    * Web frameworks like Django (used by YouTube, Instagram, and Dropbox)
        
    * Image processing (like OpenCV, Pillow)
        
    * Web scraping (like Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium)
        
    * Test frameworks
        
    * Multimedia
        
    * Scientific computing
        
    * Text processing and many more.
        

### **Why learn Python?**

Python provides many useful features to the programmer. These features make it the most popular and widely used language. We have listed below few-essential features of Python.

* Easy to use and Learn
    
* Expressive Language
    
* Interpreted Language
    
* Object-Oriented Language
    
* Open Source Language
    
* Extensible
    
* Learn Standard Library
    
* GUI Programming Support
    
* Integrated
    
* Embeddable
    
* Dynamic Memory Allocation
    
* Wide Range of Libraries and Frameworks
    

### **Python IDEs**

An integrated development environment (IDE) refers to a software application that offers computer programmers extensive software development abilities. IDEs most often consist of a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger.

Now we will look at a few popular Python IDEs.

Note that we won't be ranking these IDEs just for the sake of it because we believe that different IDEs are meant for various purposes.

### IDLE

IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment) is a default editor that accompanies Python. This IDE is suitable for beginner-level developers. Its tool can be used on Mac OS, Windows, and Linux. It is a free python IDE. It can search for multiple files and provides an Interactive interpreter with syntax highlighting, and error and i/o messages.IDLE has Smart indenting, along with basic text editor features.

Below is an example of python programming on the IDLE platform.

### PyCharm

PyCharm is a widely used Python IDE created by JetBrains.This IDE is suitable for professional developers. I use PyCharm from the beginning when I start learning. It provides free community service and payable service for PyCharm Professionals. It Supports JavaScript, CSS, and TypeScript.It provides Smart code navigation, and quick and safe code refactoring and also supports features like accessing databases directly from the IDE.

Below is an example of a simple python addition program with PyCharm.

There are also some other platforms like visual studio, atom, and sublime text.

These are mainly used for programming.

In the field of data science, we may use jupyter,spider platform for writing codes. It is easy to use, interactive and allows live code sharing and visualization comes with Anaconda distribution, which is popular for data science and [machine learning](https://blog.techlearnindia.com/what-is-machine-learning-1). it is a free platform.

I have recently worked on a machine learning project using KMeans clustering(an unsupervised machine learning technique)with jupyter framework. Following are some images of using jupyter .

In the above, we gave inputs to the machine.

The output of this code is shown below.

###  **Careers with Python**

If you know Python nicely, then you have a great career ahead. Here are just a few of the career options where Python is a key skill:

* Game developer
    
* Web designer
    
* Python developer
    
* Full-stack developer
    
* Machine learning engineer
    
* Data scientist
    
* Data analyst
    
* Data Engineer
    
* DevOps Engineer
    
* Software engineer etc.
    

So we saw there are huge career opportunities with python.

Readers today this much only.Hope you loved this blog.

Happy learning.
