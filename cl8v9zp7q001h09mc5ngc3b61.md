The popularity of data science tools is rising as demand for data scientists rises. But it can be difficult to choose which tools to learn with so many options.

In this blog post, we will discuss the top 7 data science tools that you must learn. These tools will help you analyze and understand data better, which is essential for any data scientist.

**List of 7 Data Science tools **

Top 7 data science tools you must learn:

- Python
- R Programming
- SQL
- Java
- Apache Spark
- Tensor flow
- Git


**1) Python**

R is another popular programming language that is highly used among statisticians and data scientists. They typically use R for statistical analysis, data visualization, and machine learning.

R has many features that make it attractive for data science:


- A wide range of packages
-  An active community
-  Great tools for data visualization

  These features make it perfect for scientific research!

If you’re going to learn data science with a strong focus on statistics, then you need to learn R.


**3)SQL**

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a database query language used to store, manipulate, and retrieve data from data sources. It is an essential tool for data scientists because it allows them to work with databases.

SQL has many features that make it attractive for data science: it is easy to learn, can be used to query large databases, and is widely used in industry.

If you want to learn data science involving big data sets, then you need to learn SQL. SQL is also commonly used among data analysts if that’s a career you’re also considering exploring.


**4)Java**

Apache Spark is a powerful big data processing tool that is used for data analysis, machine learning, and streaming.

Apache Spark is known for its uses in large-scale data analytics, where data scientists can run machine learning on single-node clusters and machines.

Spark has many features made for data science:


- It can process large datasets quickly.
- It supports multiple programming languages.
- It has high scalability.
- It has a wide range of libraries.


**6)Tensorflow**

TensorFlow is a powerful toolkit for machine learning developed by Google. It allows you to build and train complex models quickly.

Some ways TensorFlow is useful for data science:


- Provides a platform for data automation.
- Model monitoring.
- Model training.

Many data scientists use TensorFlow with Python to develop machine learning models. TensorFlow helps them to build complex models quickly and easily.


**7)Git**

Git is a version control system used to track code changes. It is an essential tool for data scientists because it allows them to work on projects collaboratively and keep track of their work.

Git is useful in data science for:


- Tracking changes in code.
- Allowing collaboration on coding projects.
- Keeping track of work.

If you’re planning to enter data science, Git is a must-know tool! Since you’ll be coding a lot in Python/R/Java, you’ll want to master Git to work with your team well in a collaborative coding environment.

Git is also an essential part of using GitHub, a code repository platform used by many data scientists.
