As we all are familiar with web development still I want to remind you a little bit. **Web development** refers to the creating, building, and maintaining of websites. It includes different aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an application that works over the internet i.e. websites.

An individual who creates websites is called a web developer. Web developers, or â€˜devsâ€™, do this by using a variety of coding languages. The languages they use depend on the types of tasks they are performing and the platforms on which they are working.

Web development can be classified into 2 parts :

* Front end development
    
* Back end development
    

**Front-end Development :**

The part of a website where the user interacts directly is termed the front end. It is also referred to as the â€˜client sideâ€™ of the application.

**Back-end development :**

The backend is the server side of a website. It is the part of the website that users cannot see and interact with. It is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users. It is used to store and arrange data.

### **Comparing Front-End and Back-End Development**

**Front-end development takes care of layout, design and interactivity** using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

What you see and what you use, such as the visual aspect of the website, the drop-down menus and the text, are all brought together by the front-end dev, who writes a series of programs to bind and structure the elements, make them look good and add interactivity. These programs are run through a browser.

**The backend developer engineers what is going on behind the scenes.** This is where the data is stored, and without this data, there can't be any front end. The backend of the web consists of the server that hosts the website, an application for running it and a database to contain the data.

The backend development uses computer programs to ensure that the server, the application and the database run smoothly together. This type of dev needs to analyze what a companyâ€™s needs are and provide efficient programming solutions. To do all this amazing stuff they use a variety of server-side languages, like PHP, Ruby, Python and Java.

### **Full Stack development :**

Full stack development is **the end-to-end development of applications**. It includes both the front end and back end of an application.

If both Frontend and Backend development appeal to you, you could consider becoming a full-stack developer.

Full-stack developers take care of both the front end and the back end and need to know how the web works on all levels, to determine how the client- and server sides will relate.

### Getting started with web development !

So You might think, you should know every programming language and should be a master in any web stack. But the reality is you donâ€™t need to know everything at once. You will grow your knowledge progressively. And things will begin to click. The great news is, learning to become a developer is easily accessible and affordable. Web development is a process of growing, and updating. No matter what your background is, you can always learn web development.

The first step is to decide in which aspect of web development you are interested and then start with one programming language. For example, if you are interested in the front end you can start by learning some HTML and CSS, then start working on projects as soon as you are comfortable with the basics.

### Front end Roadmap:

**HTML:** It stands for HyperText Markup Language, and acts as a skeleton for a website since it is used to make the structure of a website.

HTML has a lot of use cases, namely:

* **Web development**. Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files.Â 
    
* **Internet navigation**. Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and websites as HTML is heavily used to embed hyperlinks.Â 
    
* **Web documentation**. HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.
    

The average website includes several different HTML pages. For instance, a home page, an about page, and a contact page would all have separate HTML files.

HTML documents are files that end with a .html or .htm extension. A web browser reads the HTML file and renders its content so that internet users can view it.

**CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. It is used to style our website. More importantly, it enables you to do this independently of the HTML that makes up each web page.

**Javascript:** JavaScript is a scripting language used to provide dynamic behavior to our website. JavaScript (js) is a lightweight object-oriented programming language that is used by several websites for scripting webpages.

**Bootstrap:** Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating responsive websites and web applications. It is the most popular CSS framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites. Nowadays, the websites are perfect for all browsers (IE, Firefox, and Chrome) and all sizes of screens (Desktop, Tablets, Phablets, and Phones). There are mainly 2 versions of bootstrap used bootstrap 4 and bootstrap 5.

Some frontend frameworks and libraries :

* Angular JS
    
* React js
    
* Bootstrap
    
* Jquery etc.
    

### Back end Roadmap:

**PHP:** PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor. It is an object-oriented language simple and easy to learn.PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development.

**Java**: Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages. It is highly scalable. Java is fast, reliable and secure. From desktop to web applications, scientific supercomputers to gaming consoles, and cell phones to the Internet, Java is used in every nook and corner.

**Python:** Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently. Itâ€™s a great first language because Python code is concise and easy to read. Whatever you want to do, python can do it. From web development to machine learning to data science, Python is the language for you.

**Node.js**: Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform runtime environment. Node.js allows you to run JavaScript on the server.

Nowadays, react js and node js becomes very popular and prominent because of their quick and efficient characteristics to handle big amounts of data. If you want to become a pro web developer you can opt for react js and node js.

So readers today this much only. Let me end this blog and see in the next. Happy learning ðŸ˜Š
