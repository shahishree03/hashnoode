### **Capabilities of virtual assistants**

Virtual assistants typically perform simple jobs for end users, including the following:

* adding tasks to a calendar
    
* providing information that would normally be searched in a web browser
    
* controlling and checking the status of smart home devices, including lights, cameras and thermostats
    
* making and receiving phone calls
    
* creating text messages
    
* getting directions
    
* hearing news and weather reports
    
* finding hotels or restaurants
    
* checking flight reservations
    
* listening to music
    
* playing games.
    

### **Privacy concerns**

Some consumers have expressed privacy concerns about virtual assistants, such as Amazon Alexa and Google Home because these virtual assistants require large amounts of personal data and are always "listening" in order to respond to voice commands. Virtual assistants then retain voice interactions and personal information to improve the user experience.

Cortana, for example, works best by using data from a user's device, including emails and other communications, a user's contacts, location data, search history and data from other Microsoft services and skills -- third-party applications -- that users choose to connect with. Users can choose not to sign in and share this data with Cortana and can adjust permissions to prevent certain data from being collected, though these actions limit the virtual assistant's usefulness.

Virtual assistant providers also maintain privacy policies, which define how each company uses and shares personal information. In most cases, companies do not share customer-identifiable information without a customer's consent.
