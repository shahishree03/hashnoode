**You might wonder what is HTML ,why do you use it and how?**

HTML is a Hyper Text Markup language , which is used as a frontend designed to displayed in web browser. Imagine you are building and designing a car , a car is incomplete without its body ,HTML provides the functionality of a body which designs the structure of a web page. 
HTML is assisted by other frontends such as CSS(cascading style sheets) and JAVA SCRIPT which is a scripting language. CSS is the car paint used for decorating and java script is the car engine.
Web browsers uses HTML from web server and displays the web pages . Appearance of the web page totally depends on html ,it provides systematic, semantic and appealing view to the web page. Images , structure and links can be embedded into the web page.
Behavior of the web page is control with the help of Java script and inclusion of CSS offers and maintains the design and look of the content in the web page.
