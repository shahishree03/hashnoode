 Generally, developers use JavaScript to build complex interactive websites and browser games and to connect servers to websites and web applications.

Now we are going to discuss some of its applications-

### **Creating Interactive Websites**

JavaScript makes web pages **dynamic**. Before JavaScript, web pages were built only with HTML and CSS which are capable of creating static pages that can be styled but not interactive aside from hyperlinks.

JavaScript allows developers to implement features like:

* Showing and hiding menus or information
    
* Adding hover effects
    
* Creating image galleries in a carousel format
    
* Zooming in or zooming out on an image
    
* Playing audio or video on a web page
    
* Adding animations
    
* Creating drop-down and hamburger-style menus
    

### **Building Applications**

With the help of JavaScript’s extensive collection of frameworks, developers can efficiently build apps for mobile and web. Frameworks are libraries of pre-written JavaScript code that developers use for standard features.

The most popular JavaScript application frameworks are:

* **React.js:** A collection of JavaScript created to build user interfaces for web applications.
    
* **React Native**: a collection that allows developers to build mobile apps with JavaScript.
    
* **Node.js**: a collection that enables two-way communications with servers for exchanging data.
    

Facebook built React and React Native, which is currently using some of the world’s most powerful social media applications. React is used by websites like Uber, Pinterest, Netflix, Instagram, Amazon, Twitter, Udemy, and more. Facebook, Instagram, Shopify, Words with Friends, Skype, Pinterest, Discord, Tesla, and Uber Eats use React Native. 

### **Developing Engaging Games**

JavaScript is frequently used to create in-browser games. Developers use JavaScript to create 2D and 3D puzzles, role-playing games, racing games, platform games, and more. There are hundreds of JavaScript *game engines* that provide frameworks for building games, and many are free and open-source. The most popular game engines include Backbone, DarlingJS, and JawsJS.

Popular browser-based games built using JavaScript:

* Angry Birds
    
* 2048
    
* Little Alchemy
    
* Polycraft
    
* HexGL
    
* CrossCode
    
* Bejeweled
    
* Gods Will be Watching
    

### **What is JavaScript Designed For?**

JavaScript was designed by Brendan Eich at Netscape to remove the limitation of static pages on the web. Eich set out to create a scripting language for the web that used the syntax of **Java**, another programming language.

JavaScript was designed for:

* **Speed**: it’s faster to execute code within a web browser in its native language than it is to execute code on the server.
    
* **Dynamic pages**: pages that users can interact with weren’t possible before JavaScript’s inception.
    
* **Reducing memory use**: executing the code in the browser helps free up space on servers, which helps cut costs.
    
* **Building responsive user interfaces**: almost all social media user interfaces rely on JavaScript.
    
* **Reloading certain parts of the page independently**: those suggestions when you start typing in Google’s search bar are all thanks to JavaScript.
    
* **Responsive content**: when you change your browser window’s size, JavaSCript lets the size of the content on the page change with it.
    
* **Form validation**: required fields are enforced by JavaScript so that you don’t miss any information when you’re shopping online.
    
* **Autocomplete**: JavaScript helps save us from manually inputting our email address every time we fill out an online form.
    
* **Playing audio and video**: remember Flash? JavaScript’s audio and video capabilities are the reason it’s now obsolete. Later, HTML was updated to handle media files too, but JavaScript did it first.
    

### **Why do we need JavaScript?**

To become specialized in front-end, back-end, or full-stack development, **JavaScript is a crucial programming language for any web developer.** Without JavaScript, we wouldn’t have the dynamic and interactive web pages that have become the standard user experience we all know, love, and rely on.

### **Is JavaScript Used for Front-End or Back-End?**

Javascript is a client-side language, which *technically* makes it a front-end language. With the Node.js framework, JavaScript can also be used in the back end. Using JavaScript across the whole stack, for both front-end and back-end, is an excellent practice because it creates a cohesive application.

When it’s used for the front end, JavaScript makes web pages dynamic and interactive. It validates submission forms, updates certain pieces of content on the page without updating the entire page, shows and hides menus, and displays animations. When it's used for the back end, the Node.js framework allows a server to handle front-end data updates and build scalable network applications to process simultaneous user requests.

So today we have learned about JavaScript, where it is used, and why it is used.
