Launched by OpenAI in November 2022, ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a chatbot. It is constructed on top of the OpenAI GPT-3 family of big language models, and it is polished using supervised and reinforcement learning methods (a method of transfer learning).

On November 30, 2022, ChatGPT was introduced as a prototype. It soon gained popularity for its thorough responses and clear responses in a variety of subject areas. One key flaw was noted to be its inconsistent factual correctness.  OpenAI was allegedly valued at $29 billion after ChatGPT's release.

ChatGPT was also trained using human feedback (a technique called Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) so that the AI learned what humans expected when they asked a question. Training the LLM this way is revolutionary because it goes beyond simply training the LLM to predict the next word.Because of that training, ChatGPT may challenge certain questions and discard parts of the question that don’t make sense.

### **So how does a Chat GPT works?**

The program gathers information from enormous volumes of data based on the user's instructions.

Sounds simple, but without the right "training," it's quite simple for AI to just spout gibberish. Due to the fact that ChatGPT genuinely sounds rather human, it has gained attention and stirred up some controversy online. perhaps too human?

In contrast, there are various AI programs available that allow you to experiment with some of their parameters, providing an understanding of what is happening in the background.

For instance, Adam King, a Canadian developer, produced Inferkit. You may "dial up" the "sampling temperature" with Inferkit to increase the text's unpredictability. The outcome is frequently amusing.

It analyses input text by breaking it up into smaller components like words or short phrases. Piecing everything together, **ChatGPT** reveals its response.

What sets **ChatGPT** apart is that it was trained through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).

Human AI trainers fine-tuned the initial ChatGPT model by “playing both sides” of the interaction and giving the AI feedback on which of its responses was most appropriate. A “reward” model trains the AI to recognize when it has produced human-sounding responses.

The developers note some snags in the model, including occasional nonsensical responses, high sensitivity to tweaks in the input phrase, repetition, assumptions being made when prompts aren’t clear, and susceptibility to respond to inappropriate requests, including those with harmful instructions or those that lead to biased behavior in the AI.

### FEATURES OF CHAT GPT

1.\] Chat GPT has more versatility, flexibility and improvised skills than any other bot.

2.\] Emulates a Linux system; to simulate an entire chat room

3.\] ChatGPT's training data includes man pages and information about internet phenomena and programming languages.

4.\] The core function of a chatbot is to mimic a human conversationalist.

5.\] ChatGPT, unlike the majority of chatbots, can recall earlier commands provided to it throughout the same discussion.

6.\] To prevent offensive outputs from being presented to and produced from ChatGPT, queries are filtered through OpenAI's company-wide moderation API, and potentially racist prompts are dismissed.

7.\] ChatGPT aims to lessen detrimental and dishonest reactions in contrast to its predecessor, InstructGPT.

8.\] Another advantage of Chat GPT is its ability to adapt to different contexts and situations. It can understand the context of a conversation and generate appropriate responses based on that context.

9.\] GPT can be used to summarize long pieces of text, making it easier for users to quickly understand the main points of a message. 

10.\] Chat GPT can be used to complete sentences or paragraphs, helping users to write more efficiently and accurately. 

**With great features, come certain limitations.**

1.\] ChatGPT sometimes responds with plausible-sounding but incorrect or illogical answers.

2.\] An important limitation of ChatGPT is that the quality of the output depends on the quality of the input.

3.\] Training data also suffers from algorithmic bias, which may be revealed when ChatGPT responds to prompts including descriptors of people.

4.\] It is trained to provide answers that feel right to humans, the answers can trick humans that the output is correct.

**Does Open AI Chat GPT has abilities to replace certain jobs?**

To some extent yes Chat GPT can replace copywriters, blog writers, and full time caption writers. Chat GPT can provide every answer, blog and caption on a single question asked by a human. With one click u will have your answers ready to your questions. You can even target a certain object or people just by telling the Chat GPT. It provides lots of hashtags and captions which are easy for social media users, also it is available 24x7.

Also to the programmers, it might be worrisome, as chatbot provides you with every programming language. Not only it provides programming but also translates and debugs it which makes it more compatible and flexible. For simple Python scripts and web page developers, Chatbot is more reliable.

As you know most of the apps like zomato, swiggy relies on the chatbot to answer the questions and feedback received from the person ordering. It helps the company to take care of it by providing customer support. Chat GPT provides empathetic answers to furious customers who are unsatisfied with the product or an item.

## Conclusion: 

In summary, Chat GPT is a powerful tool for chatbots and other conversational AI applications. It uses advances in AI, such as transformer architecture and large-scale pre-training, to generate human-like responses and engage in more natural and varied conversations with users. Its ability to adapt to different contexts and situations allows it to provide relevant and accurate information to users in a variety of situations. 

It is also important to consider its limitations and to use it appropriately to achieve the best results. It is important to carefully select and pre-process the training data, to be mindful of potential biases or errors, and to consider the computational demands of the model when choosing which applications it is appropriate for.

By understanding and addressing these limitations, we can maximize the benefits of Chat GPT and other AI models and minimize their potential drawbacks.
