On 10th October 1994,**CSS**-Cascading style sheets was first proposed by **Hakon Wium Lie**. As HTML grew , CSS provided a wider option and this evolution gave more flexibility to the developers in controling the appearance of the site .

**W3C-world wide web consortium** recommended and released CSS -1 on *17th December 1996*

**Cascading Style sheets**(CSS) is a style sheet which describes the layout and design of the appearance and presentation of a web page which assists markup languages such as HTML or XML.**CSS **converts an off looking HTML page into a constructive and responsive website and it is a very demanding skill which offers you to customize your own build page.  
Production of the car is incomplete without giving it an exterior look with paint, similarly css functions in a manner which completes the design and appearances of the page.
You would rather potray it in a way that **HTML ** is incomplete without **CSS**.

***There are 3 ways to add CSS to HTML :-***

1. *Style tag*   - Adding style tag directly to HTML.

2. *Inline CSS* - Adding CSS using style attribute.

3. *External CSS* - Adding a stylesheet(.css) to HTML using link tag.

Personally, I will go for External CSS as it provides you a systematic and constructive coding format.There will be a seperate coding file which makes it easier to insert ,delete or add any styling, you just have to connect it with HTML ,with a link tag.

1. **Element Selector**- It is used to select an element based off the tag name. 
       for example-  h2{ color : white; }
       This sets the color of element "h2" as white .

2. **Id Selector**-It is used to select an element with a given id. Hash is used to target id.
       for example -   #first{ background color : aqua; }
       This sets the background color of the targeted id to aqua. 

3. **Class Selector**-Select an element with a given class. Fullstop is used to target class.
        for example - .second{ border : 2px solid black; }
        This sets the border of the class to solid black of width 2px.

***Different attributes you can add*** : Color , background color , border , height  ,width
  margin ,padding ,text-decoration ,text-transform ,font size ,font-family and more.
