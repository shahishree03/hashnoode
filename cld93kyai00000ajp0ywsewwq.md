From freeing up humans to advancing medicine AI and ML are rapidly changing the face of everyday life. AI and ML are continuously growing.

In the past few years, the world is changing fast, because of artificial intelligence and machine learning.While both have positive impacts as well as negative impacts on society, technological field, and in our day-to-day life.

Generally, when most hear the words artificial intelligence(AI), the first thing that comes to mind is robots. However, this is not true. Artificial intelligence is a process of simulation of human knowledge that is programmed in different machines, using algorithms.

And machine learning is a branch or an application of AI where the machines learn from their experience and make predictions. It is the technology that is used to train machines to perform predictions, recommendations, estimations, etc., based on historical data or experience.

## History of AI :

AI has come in the early 1950s. Artificial Intelligence derives from an area of computer science used to create intelligent programs that can problem solve, plan, learn, recognize speech, etc. Back then, when the ideas of artificial intelligence were first presented, computers were the primary source looked at to house such intellectual programs. However, in the 1950s, computers were costly and could not store commands given, which is essential in the development of the AI system. After many modifications, computers could now not only execute all sorts of commands but could store them as well. From this modernization, many were able to explore the different realms of artificial intelligence more in-depth than before.

Today, artificial intelligence is used daily. From email filters to suggestions, from social media accounts to customer service chatbots. The application of artificial intelligence is said to help make life more efficient. People can connect with friends and family, request rides using sharing apps, and navigate to places unknown. It seems that AI has made it possible for people to accomplish much more by working together with its intelligent software. The recent and trending topic of AI is ChatGPT which *interacts conversationally.*

For the future of artificial intelligence, AI language and self-driven cars are now in progress. AI language will cover conversations that are smoother between humans and automated machines, as well as being able to translate a conversation between two languages in the present time. On the other side of the horizon, concepts of driverless cars have been announced, and much work is being done to produce a proven concept within the next 20 years. In the beginning, artificial intelligence started as a field whose goal was to replicate human-level intelligence in a machine. The goal now of those researching and creating AI is to produce programs that surpass human capabilities cognitively in many if not all tasks.

 Artificial Intelligence is given the capability to learn intelligently, by permitting machines the ability to learn from experience and in turn, perform tasks that are similar to that of humans. Some components that make up artificial intelligence are; machine learning, deep learning, and cognitive computing. These elements give AI the skills to process massive amounts of big data that is generated in the world, regularly. IT professionals write algorithms that allow AIs to sift through and analyze data analytics that could be useful for things such as figuring out consumer habits for a business. With little to no human dealings and massive amounts of data being fed to AI systems, they can take on more tasks, solve more problems, and over time, learn more to become smarter than humans.

## History of machine learning :

Machine Learning was first conceived from the mathematical modeling of neural networks. A paper by logician Walter Pitts and neuroscientist Warren McCulloch, published in 1943, attempted to mathematically map out thought processes and decision-making in human cognition. In 1950, Alan Turing proposed the “Turing Test” to determine if a computer has real intelligence. To pass the test, a computer must be able to fool a human into believing it is also human. In 1952, Arthur Samuel wrote the first computer learning program i.e. The program was the game of checkers, and the **IBM** computer improved at the game the more it played, studying which moves made up winning strategies and incorporating those moves into its program **IBM** computer improved the game the more it played, studying which moves made up winning strategies and incorporating those moves into its program. After that many machine learning algorithms were introduced to train the machine.

## Why are machine learning and AI growing so fast?

ML and AI both becoming the technology of the future. Because it provides potent capabilities in a variety of industrial sectors. Among the most important are the following: 

**Processing Speed:** 

A massive amount of data is generated and accessed by almost every organization today. The data flow around us is so big that traditional tools cannot handle it. Machine Learning and AI is the solution here. It automates data generation, storage, retrieval, and analysis. ML models extract meaningful insights from large amounts of structured or unstructured data at high speeds. 

**Round-the-Clock Operation :**

The algorithms used by machine learning are robots that do your work 24\*7. With tools like MLOps and AutoML, ML plays a significant role in automating business operations. Many routine processes such as network monitoring, database management, data integration, and so on are eliminated, allowing businesses to focus on more specialized tasks. 

ChatGPT is a trained AI model called which interacts conversationally. The dialogue format makes it possible to answer every query, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests.

**Ability to Learn and Improve**

Both ML and AI can learn. Most machine learning algorithms are designed to improve performance as they process more data.. Netflix, YouTube, Tinder, and Amazon are companies that use recommender systems. According to Forbes, 75% of Netflix users select movies/shows recommended by the company's machine-learning algorithms.
