Now we are seen some features of Java that makes it Widely used Language.

## ***Features of Java***

### ***1 :-Secure***

Security is the biggest Concern of Everyone, When we talk about Security Java Provides Security Feature to Programmer's.

### ***3 :-High Performance***

Java is High Performance Language it Provides high Performance than any other traditional interpreted Programing language.

### *4 :-Portable*

Java is portable because it help you to carry the Java Bytecode to any Platform.

### *5 :- Dynamic*

Java is more Dynamic than C/C++. The source code which is written in one platform that code can be executed in any platform

We can define that any programming language which allows Run-time modification, is a Dynamic language

### *6 :- Simple*

Java programs are compiled into byte code and that byte code is platform-independent.

### ***9:- Distributed***

It Help users to create distributed applications in Java, that's why we Call Java as Distributed Language.

### *10:- Object-Oriented*

Java is Purely Object Oriented Programming Language.

Object-Oriented Programming provides a clear structure for the programs. Java is one of the most widely used programming languages for Object- Oriented Programming.
