These PHP coding standards are intended for the WordPress community as a whole. They are mandatory for WordPress Core and we encourage you to use them for your themes and plugins as well.

While themes and plugins may choose to follow a different coding style, these coding standards are not just about code style, but also encompass established best practices regarding interoperability, translatability, and security in the WordPress ecosystem, so, even when using a different code style, we recommend you still adhere to the WordPress Coding Standards in regard to these best practices.

While not all code may fully comply with these standards (yet), all newly committed and/or updated code should fully comply with these coding standards.

Also see the PHP Inline Documentation Standards for further guidelines.

If you want to automatically check your code against this standard, you can use the official WordPress Coding Standards tooling, which is run using PHP\_CodeSniffer.

If you’re looking around on the web for information about PHP, you’ll see it’s a “server-side” scripting language. Unfortunately, that short definition isn’t helpful for beginners.

The term “server-side” just means that all those PHP files in WordPress do their work on your web hosting server. So, in simple terms, when someone goes to your website, WordPress accesses the PHP files to get your database information (like your blog post content) to show it to your visitor.

That sounds simple enough. However, there’s a little problem. Web browsers don’t read PHP. They read HTML.

HTML is a type of scripting language used to create website pages. We refer to HTML as a “client-side” scripting language.
