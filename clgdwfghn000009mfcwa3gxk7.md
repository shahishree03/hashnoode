## Benefits of blockchain

**What needs to change:** Operations often waste effort on duplicate record-keeping and third-party validations. Record-keeping systems can be vulnerable to fraud and cyberattacks. Limited transparency can slow data verification. And with the arrival of IoT, transaction volumes have exploded. All of this slows business, drains the bottom line — and means we need a better way. Enter blockchain.

1. #### <mark>Greater trust</mark>
    
    With blockchain, as a member of a members-only network, you can rest assured that you are <mark>receiving accurate and timely data ,</mark> and that your confidential blockchain records will be shared only with network members to whom you have specifically granted access.
    
2. #### <mark>Greater security</mark>
    
    Consensus on data accuracy is required from all network members, and all validated transactions are immutable because they are <mark>recorded permanently.</mark> No one, not even a system administrator, can delete a transaction.
    
3. #### <mark>More efficiencies</mark>
    
    With a distributed ledger that is shared among members of a network, <mark>time-wasting record reconciliations are eliminated</mark>. And to <mark>speed transactions,</mark> a set of rules — called a <mark>smart contract</mark> — can be stored on the blockchain and executed automatically.
    

## Types of blockchain networks

### There are several ways to build a blockchain network. They can be public, private, permissioned or built by a consortium

* #### <mark>Public blockchain networks</mark>
    
    A public blockchain is one that <mark>anyone can join and participate in</mark>, such as Bitcoin. Drawbacks might include substantial computational <mark>power required, little or no privacy for transactions, and weak security</mark>. These are important considerations for enterprise use cases of blockchain.
    
* #### <mark>Private blockchain networks</mark>
    
    A private blockchain network, similar to a public blockchain network, is a <mark>decentralized peer-to-peer network</mark>. However, one organization governs the network, controlling who is allowed to participate, execute a consensus protocol and maintain the shared ledger. Depending on the use case, this can significantly <mark>boost trust and confidence</mark> between participants. A private blockchain can be run behind a corporate firewall and even be hosted on premises.
    
* #### <mark>Permissioned blockchain networks</mark>
    
    Businesses who set up a private blockchain will generally set up a permissioned blockchain network. It is important to note that public blockchain networks can also be permissioned. <mark> This places restrictions on who is allowed to participate in the network and in what transactions</mark>. Participants need to obtain an invitation or permission to join.
    
* #### <mark>Consortium blockchains</mark>
    
    Multiple organizations can <mark>share the responsibilities of maintaining a blockchain.</mark> These pre-selected organizations determine who may submit transactions or access the data. A consortium blockchain is ideal for business when all participants need to be permissioned and have a shared responsibility for the blockchain.
    

### Blockchain security

#### <mark>Risk management systems for blockchain networks </mark>  

When building an enterprise blockchain application, it’s important to have a <mark>comprehensive security strategy that uses cybersecurity frameworks, assurance services and best practices to reduce risks against attacks and fraud.</mark>
