### **Web Development:**

Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet or an intranet. Web development can range from a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.

Also known as website development, it refers to the tasks associated with creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications that run online on a browser. It may, however, also include web design, web programming, and database management.

### **Future of Web Development of 2023:**

*The future of web development demands the inclusion of web development trends like Progressive Web Apps, Motion UI, AI Chatbots, Voice Search Optimization, Push Notification, and many more.*

### **Trends Involved:**

**Animation in UI:** The primary role of UI animations is to draw users‚Äô attention to an important CTA or show them what to do next. UI animations allow designers to communicate with users without text.

For example, a progress bar will animate to draw your attention so you can see how much of a signup process you must still complete. The alternative would be text somewhere on the user interface saying something like, ‚Äúyou have completed 20% of this signup process.‚Äù

**Mobile Responsive Design:** A responsive website is one with a layout that adjusts to the screen based on the device it's viewed from. The content on the page automatically changes to fit the difference in screen size. The elements on the page are flexible. Also, unnecessary images and elements are hidden to provide a better browsing experience.

There are four screen sizes responsive design focuses on:

* Desktop monitors
    
* Smaller desktop
    
* Tablets
    
* Mobile phones
    

**Voice search optimization:** Voice search optimization is the process of optimizing your pages to appear in voice searches. When you optimize for voice search, you optimize for the way people conduct verbal searches. Voice search optimization gives you the chance to have your pages read out loud by a voice search device.

Voice search SEO is the practice of optimizing your website to show up in search engine results in pages for voice searches.

**AI & Cybersecurity:** AI uses machine learning and deep learning to recognize patterns on the network and cluster them, it will then detect deviations or security incidents from the norm before responding to them. These patterns can help to improve security in the future.

AI is used in cyber security to quickly analyze millions of events and identify many different types of threats ‚Äì from malware exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities. This technology is a self-learning system that automatically and continuously gathers data from across your enterprise information systems.

**Accelerated mobile pages:** Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) is an open-source project created to improve the performance of web pages for mobile devices. The project was spearheaded by Google and Twitter. The technology behind AMP enables lightweight pages that load more quickly for smartphone and tablet users.

AMP allows you to create pages that load quickly without compromising creativity and brand expression.

### **Various Tools used in web development:**

* GitHub.
    
* Chrome Developer Tools.
    
* Sublime Text.
    
* Marvel.
    
* Visual Studio Code.
    
* Node Package Manager (npm)
    
* Sass.
    
* Bootstrap.
    

### **Role of Artificial Intelligence in web development-**

Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that makes computers simulate human intelligence to perform various tasks. Computers use machine learning and natural language processing to achieve this. Artificial intelligence systems are built to learn and adapt to human inputs to solve problems.

Web developers use AI on websites to improve user experience. That is how social media sites personalize user feeds according to the accounts and posts they interact with. Additionally, AI helps web developers behind the scenes build websites. Some software applications allow them to review page elements, find errors, troubleshoot problems, and optimize page performance. One such application is the safari web inspector tool that iOS developers use with Corellium to debug web pages to be accessed via the Safari browser.

#### **Benefits of Developing Websites With AI Implementation:**

1. Improved User Experience
    
2. ##### Better Search Results
    
3. ##### Customized Online Store Experience
    
4. ##### Enhanced Communication
    
5. ##### Effective Website Building
    

### **The emergence of voice and chat interfaces:**

Voice interfaces and chatbots are computer programs that allow humans to converse and interact with computers through either spoken commands or written text.

Both voice interfaces and chatbots work in a similar way, using artificial intelligence AI and deep learning, Big Data and natural language processing and natural language generation to both understand and respond to human speech. Although they‚Äôre underpinned by the same technologies, voice interfaces (including digital assistants like Siri and smart speakers like Amazon‚Äôs Alexa) and chatbots interact with users in slightly different ways. Voice interfaces respond to spoken language commands.

while chatbots interact with people through a written chat interface, such as Facebook Messenger or a web-based application. In both cases, the computer uses natural language processing to understand the text and then analyzes the text using AI and deep learning algorithms to determine the best response.
