As the name suggests, Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that use objects in programming, they use objects as a primary source to implement what is to happen in the code.

Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that provides many concepts, such as inheritance, data binding, polymorphism, etc. Simula is considered the first object-oriented programming language. The programming paradigm where everything is represented as an object is known as a truly object-oriented programming language.

Objects are seen by the viewer or user, performing tasks assigned by you. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism etc. in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

The main ideas behind Java’s Object-Oriented Programming, OOP concepts include abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. Basically, Java OOP concepts let us create working methods and variables, then re-use all or part of them without compromising security. Grasping OOP concepts is key to understanding how Java works.

## **Java defines OOPs concepts as follows:**

### **1\. Pillars of OOPs**

**1\. Abstraction:-**

Using simple things to represent complexity. We all know how to turn the TV on, but we don’t need to know how it works in order to enjoy it. In Java, abstraction means simple things like objects, classes and variables represent more complex underlying code and data. This is important because it lets you avoid repeating the same work multiple times.

**2\. Encapsulation:-**

The practice of keeping fields within a class private, then providing access to those fields via public methods. Encapsulation is a protective barrier that keeps the data and code safe within the class itself. We can then reuse objects like code components or variables without allowing open access to the data system-wide.

**3\. Inheritance:-**

A special feature of Object-Oriented Programming in Java, Inheritance lets programmers create new classes that share some of the attributes of existing classes. Using Inheritance lets us build on previous work without reinventing the wheel.

**4\. Polymorphism**:-

Allows programmers to use the same word in Java to mean different things in different contexts. One form of polymorphism is method overloading. That’s when the code itself implies different meanings. The other form is method overriding. That’s when the values of the supplied variables imply different meanings. Let’s delve a little further.

### **2\. Class:-**

A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. Using classes, you can create multiple objects with the same behavior instead of writing their code multiple times. This includes classes for objects occurring more than once in your code. In general, class declarations can include these components in order:

**Modifiers:** A class can be public or have default access (Refer to this for details).

**Class name:** The class name should begin with the initial letter capitalized by convention.

**Superclass (if any):** The name of the class’s parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the keyword extends. A class can only extend (subclass) one parent.

**Interfaces (if any):** A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, if any, preceded by the keyword implements. A class can implement more than one interface.

**Body:** The class body is surrounded by braces, { }.

### 3\. Object :-

It is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represents real-life entities. A typical Java program creates many objects, which as you know, interact by invoking methods. An object consists of :

**State:** It is represented by attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.

**Behavior:** It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object with other objects.

**Identity:** It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.
