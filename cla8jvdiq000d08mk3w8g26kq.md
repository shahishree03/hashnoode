Starting of with, you might wonder **what is React Javascript** ,so basically **React** is *Javascript library* used for constructing and formatting user interfaces. *Facebook *developed React js as a open source library for front end.
In a comparison with *Vanilla js *, **React Js** is faster and builds interacting user interfaces efficiently and within less time , also it uses less codes.

Reacts primary role in an application is to handle the view layer of the application by providing the best and fast rendering execution.React.js motivates developers to separate these complex UIs into **individual reusable components** that forms the building blocks of the whole UI. In doing so, the ReactJS framework combines the speed and efficiency of JavaScript and **enhances **the maipulation of DOM to render web pages **faster** and create **highly dynamic** and **interactive** web applications.

**WHY TO USE REACT JS ?**

**1. SYSTEMATIC CODE FORMAT :**
It allows the users to seperate the complex UI's and break it into small sets which can easily be edited or changed , this makes the javascript faster and enhances its functionality and create appealing web applications. It is very lightweight, which achieves a hassle free and rapid workflow.

**2. FLEXIBILITY AND COMPATIBILITY :**
Using React js for web development may come in extremely convenient because React is one of those cases where you get the hang of a single technology to easily reuse it across a range of platforms.Since it is a library by nature, its primary purpose is to create seperate web design elements and components.

**3. FREE REUSABIITY OF COMPONENTS :**
REACT is used specifically for creating separate components. And this is exactly why created components can be easily reused. Once youâ€™ve created a React.js web application element, you get a unique object that can be reused and applied to any other project you are working on which is compatible with the React-based code.

**4. DOM MANIPULATION :**
React js manipulates DOM to render web pages faster and efficiently also improves the performance of responsive web applications.

**5.REACT NATIVE :**
This is where React Native comes in as a true game-changer that opens up for your native and hybrid mobile app development for iOS and Android. Naturally, you lose certain code reusability opportunities, but only in favor of proper native performance and system management.
Building a one-size-fits-all app can obviously be cheaper while you can also go hybrid for more custom results, using a single codebase for somewhat different solutions created for separate operating environments.

**6. EXTENDED HTML :**
You may utilize the declarative HTML syntax directly in JavaScript code. To show the user interface, browsers decode HTML texts. They do it by building DOM trees, which can then be manipulated using JavaScript to create interactive UI.
JAVA script can be declare in HTML , the same way with the hep of react you can declare HTML into Java script.

**HERE YOU CAN SEE HOW YOU USE REACT **

import React from 'react';

import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

import './index.css';

import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render

{
 
"<"App / ">",

document.getElementbyId('root')

};

**CONCLUSION :**
We believe JavaScript frameworks can make a revolution in the software development world. So, keep calm and learn JavaScript! You should already know when to use React professionally - the opportunities are truly vast.
Still not sure when to use React.js for web development? Or why use React for the web app creation at all when there are a bunch of alternatives out there? 
There are courses which are available for you that might help you understand more and get a better view about REACT Js.
