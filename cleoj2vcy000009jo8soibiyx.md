Flutter is a free and open-source mobile UI framework created by Google. It was released in May 2017. Flutter allows developers to create a native mobile application with only one codebase. This means that we can use one programming language and one codebase to create two different apps (for iOS and Android).

Flutter consists of two important parts:

* SDK (Software Development Kit): A collection of tools that helps to develop the application. This includes tools to compile the code into native machine code (code for iOS and Android).
    
* Framework (UI Library based on widgets): A collection of reusable UI elements (buttons, text inputs, sliders, and so on) where developers can personalize their own needs.
    

To develop apps with Flutter, we use a programming language called Dart. The language was created by Google in October 2011, but it has improved a lot over the past years.

Dart focuses on front-end development, it is used to create mobile and web applications. If you know a bit of programming, Dart is a typed object programming language.

### Why Flutter?

The official website of [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/?gclid=Cj0KCQiA6fafBhC1ARIsAIJjL8mEYP3eNPnWXE-p0XZI-vNf7jHRt9LEGidIFdanE1lHJI0eKNfEwSwaAqq1EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) has mentioned its characteristics and benefits you can go through. Its characteristics are fast, productive and flexible. Flutter is a multi-platform and it supports Mobile, Web, Desktop and Embedded devices.

**Simple to learn and use**

Flutter is a modern framework. It’s way simpler to create mobile applications with it. If you are familiar with Java, Swift, or React Native, you'll notice how Flutter is different. In flutter, the attractive feature is that you can create a real native application without a bunch of code.

**Quick compilation and maximum productivity**

In Flutter, you can change your code and see the results in real-time. It’s called Hot-Reload. It takes a short amount of time after saving to update the application itself.

Significant modifications force to reload the app. But if the work is done such as designing and changing the size of an element, it’s in real-time!

**Ideal for startup MVPs**

Flutter is a good choice for startups where the time is limited or the minimum time given to deliver the product(application).

Why it's useful for MVP:

* It’s cheaper to develop a mobile application with Flutter because we don’t need to create and maintain two mobile apps (one for iOS and one for Android).
    
* One developer is all you need to create your MVP.
    
* It’s performant –we can't visualize the difference between a native application and a Flutter app because of its amazing performance.
    
* It’s beautiful – we can use widgets provided by Flutter and personalize them to create a valuable UI for the customers.
    

**Good documentation**

New technology needs to have good documentation. Flutter has good documentation and everything is very detailed with easy examples for basic use cases.

**Supported by Android Studio and VS Code**

Flutter is available on different IDEs. The two main code editors for developing with this technology are Android Studio (IntelliJ) and VS Code.

Android Studio is a complete software with everything already integrated. You must download Flutter and Dart plugins to start.VS Code is a lightweight tool, and everything is configurable through plugins from the marketplace.

I use VS code; I am pretty comfortable with it because of its easy and attractive interface. You are free to choose your preferred IDE!

### Why is Flutter a boon for Startups and Companies?

The main goal of any company is to acquire more customers, and in the case of app startups, their main concern is to increase user acquisition, irrespective of the platform (iOS or Android). Many startups that provide their services via an app or startups that are completely dependent on the app, must decide whether they would like to have the app in the native format or would have an app that could be used irrespective of the operating platform. Apps that are of native format are required to be developed individually for every platform. The majority of startups require an app that could work on different mobile platforms in one go, so the role of flutter comes into the picture.

### Features of flutter !

Flutter structure offers the accompanying elements to designers:

1. Present day and receptive structure.
    
2. Utilizes Dart programming language and it is extremely simple to learn.
    
3. A quick turn of events.
    
4. Delightful and liquid UIs.
    
5. Colossal gadget list.
    
6. Runs the same UI for numerous stages.
    
7. Superior execution application.
    

The Advantages we can list regarding flutter are; flutter is c**ross-platform Operations, a less number of developers are needed,** **reduces development costs, minimum time required, powerful Design with minimum effort.**

Flutter accompanies delightful and adjustable gadgets for superior execution and extraordinary versatile application. It satisfies every one of the custom necessities and prerequisites

Despite its many benefits, vacillation has the accompanying downsides in it; Apps made via flutter work a bit slower on older devices, as the code interpreter is designed to work with native code, on older devices. Many studies show that the performance of apps made with flutter is directly dependent on the processor used. As Flutter is a cross-platform language, the apps developed using flutter works a bit differently than a native app, although the required operation remains the same. Native apps are designed to work for a specific platform, while apps made via flutter are designed to work on cross-platform devices, so the app has to be in a common position to work on both platforms.

At present many companies have switched to flutter to develop apps, and the requirement of developers to have experience in flutter is appreciated via applying for a job. On the other hand, flutter is also being improved so that the disadvantages faced by developers, can be reduced. Many other technologies such as firebase, are extending their support to flutter, and this is helping flutter build a strong and reliable ecosystem. Many companies such as Alibaba, Geekants, and Tencent have started to use flutter. All those app developers who wish to work in the app development industry should first learn the native languages for app development and then should learn Flutter. Since the demand for flutter is growing exponentially, the demand for native app developers will decrease in the coming years. So having experience in Flutter is mandatory, if anyone wishes to work in the app development industry in the coming years.
