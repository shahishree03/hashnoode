The world runs on technology, but it also runs on data. Data analysis is the key to making the right decisions in business and in life.

You use it to prove that with the right amount of nutrition, exercise, and commitment, you can reach your health goals. Amazon uses it to recommend products you'll actually use. Google uses it to help you get to the office on time.

Since user information is all around us, it's an ideal time to become a Data Analyst.

When we pay attention to the data, we’re able to make sound decisions that solve problems and enhance positive growth. Below, you can learn exactly what a Data Analyst does, and what the career trajectory looks like so you can decide if it’s right for you.


**Data Analytics Career Path**

The career path of a Data Analyst typically starts with an Analyst 1 position, and then progresses to Analyst II, Senior Analyst, and then Data Scientist or even Chief Technology Officer.

So if you pursue a career in data analysis, you have a long future of steady job growth ahead.

Here are two of the most common career trajectories for analysts.


**Freelancer to Consultant**

If you're looking for a job with flexible hours, work from home capabilities and the ability to choose your own projects, then you'll thrive as a freelancer.

Once you build up a client base and gain a few years of experience, companies may start hiring you as a consultant. You'll work with a company for a set period of time and help them improve their business operations and discover new efficiencies. Consultants enjoy maximum work flexibility paired with hefty salaries.


**Manager to CTO**

If you prefer the structure and stability of working as a salaried employee, then you'll probably move up from entry-level analyst to manager. If you make an impression with the higher-ups and work to develop your leadership abilities, you could eventually land the role of Chief Technology Officer.

With the right data analysis skills, you can shape the ideal career for your personality and financial goals. It all starts by becoming a Data Analyst.


**What Job Titles Can You Earn in Data Analytics?**

If you’re pursuing a data analyst career path, it’s important to know that job titles vary across industries. You could find yourself analyzing animal grazing trends, healthcare insurance data sets, or measuring global fashion trends. There’s a wide range of data analytics jobs (including a few at some of the coolest companies on earth).

Here are the most common job titles that you’ll be qualified for once you finish our Data Analytics Thinkful course:

- Data Analyst
- Business Analyst
- Financial Analyst
- Operations Analyst
- Risk Analyst
- Research Analyst
- Data Journalist
- Business Intelligence Analyst
- Marketing Analyst

Some of these titles, such as Data Analyst, Business Analyst, and Operations Analyst, are pretty standard. Others, like Financial Analyst, Data Journalist, and Marketing Analyst, are specific to a particular industry.

Even though job titles vary, a core component of the role remains: translating data into valuable business insights.


**What  Are The Responsibilities of A Data Analyst?**

Data analysts take raw information – numbers or qualitative data sets – to tell narratives that help companies make better business decisions. Your primary goal in a data analyst career is to take large volumes of complex data, extract insights, and help solve problems.

Skills you’ll need to thrive in a data analytics career are, but not limited to, SQL, Microsoft Excel, critical thinking, and basic programming knowledge.

It’s tough for companies to manage sales, marketing, operations, finance, and more while also having a solid focus on data analysis and reporting. A skilled data analyst will help show the big picture of how to make improvements in key business functions.

Companies have all sorts of questions on what to do next, how to improve, or how to shift gears. Data analysts can help provide clarity to what’s really going on and help answer those questions. Depending on a company's size and needs, the role of data analyst will vary. For larger companies, data analysts usually specialize in a particular topic area or team, while smaller companies may allow for their data analyst to work on several different data projects at a time.

If you’re a data analyst at a hospital, you could be solely focused on patient analytics and monitoring how patients feel about their care at your hospital. Maybe you’re analyzing surveys directly from the patients or you’re analyzing performance data of the nursing staff to see how patient health has improved.

Either way, your analysis will help provide insights on what areas of care should be paid more attention and which areas are doing well. A data analyst at the Major League Baseball Association (MLB) could focus on running analysis on consumers and fan engagement. Using data, you would keep up with how the MLB brand is performing across media channels like ESPN+ and YouTube TV. You could also review data sets and provide analysis about how the brand is performing with other partners like a sports apparel brand.

Sometimes organizations need data analysts to answer a specific question from a specific data set. Other times, data analysts must explore more broadly to solve issues and provide insight.


**Data Analytics Skills**

You might be wondering if you have the right foundational skills to make you a successful data analyst. If you have a knack for any of the following, then you'll probably enjoy learning data analysis and crunching numbers full-time:

- Logical thinking
- Problem solving
- Curiosity about data
- Basic mathematical abilities
- Attention to detail

There's high demand for analysis skills in different industries. Since data makes the world go ‘round, you can find a data analytics career in almost every industry. And across the board, the average Data Analyst salary is a big draw.


**Is a Data Analyst Career Right for You?**

Data analytics is a career path that allows you to use a variety of complex skills to help overall business functions. You’ll be required to show critical thinking, strategic analysis, and cross-functional communication skills, while also needing a strong sense of focus and determination to read over intricate datasets day in and day out. If you like independent work, but also value contributing insights to a larger team to help make improvements, then this could be a good career for you.

Professionals in data analytics are good at gathering key information, asking the right questions, and using strong business acumen to provide important insights. After a TechLearn course, you’ll become a master at business tools like Microsoft Excel, Tableau, SQL, and more. Our Data Analytics Flex and Data Analytics Immersion courses are well equipped to teach you the skills you need to succeed in the field.
