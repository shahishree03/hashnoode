**Blockchain defined:** Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the <mark>process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network</mark>. An *asset* can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.

**Why blockchain is important:** Business runs on information. The faster it’s received and the more accurate it is, the better. Blockchain is ideal for delivering that information because it <mark> provides immediate, shared and completely transparent information </mark> stored on an immutable ledger that can be accessed only by permitted network members. A blockchain network can <mark> track orders, payments, accounts, production </mark> and much more. And because members share a single view of the truth, you can see all details of a transaction end to end, giving you greater confidence, as well as new efficiencies and opportunities.

### Key elements of a blockchain

* #### Distributed ledger technology
    
    All network participants have access to the distributed ledger and its immutable record of transactions. With this shared ledger, <mark>transactions are recorded only once, eliminating the duplication </mark> of effort that’s typical of traditional business networks.
    
* #### Immutable records
    
    <mark>No participant can change or tamper with a transaction after it’s been recorded </mark> to the shared ledger. If a transaction record includes an error, a new transaction must be added to reverse the error, and both transactions are then visible.
    
* #### Smart contracts
    
    To <mark>speed transactions</mark>, <mark>a set of rules</mark> — called a [<mark>smart contract</mark>](https://www.ibm.com/in-en/topics/smart-contracts) — is stored on the blockchain and executed automatically. A smart contract can define conditions for corporate bond transfers, include terms for travel insurance to be paid and much more.
    

### How blockchain works :

* #### <mark>As each transaction occurs, it is recorded as a “block” of data</mark>
    

Those transactions show the movement of an asset that can be tangible (a product) or intangible (intellectual). The <mark> data block can record the information of your choice:</mark> who, what, when, where, how much and even the condition — such as the temperature of a food shipment.

* #### <mark>Each block is connected to the ones before and after it</mark>
    

These blocks form a chain of data as an asset moves from place to place or ownership changes hands. <mark>The blocks confirm the exact time and sequence of transactions, and the blocks link securely together to prevent any block from being altered or a block being inserted between two existing blocks.</mark>

* #### Transactions are blocked together in an irreversible chain: a blockchain
    

Each additional block strengthens the verification of the previous block and hence the entire blockchain. This renders the blockchain tamper-evident, delivering the key strength of immutability. This removes the possibility of tampering by a malicious actor — and builds a ledger of transactions you and other network members can trust.
