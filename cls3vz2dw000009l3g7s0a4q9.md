### **#Day 1**: Unleash Your Inner Demon Slayer: Read and Manipulate Images with Tanjiro!

**Intro:**

Welcome, aspiring image slayers! Join Tanjiro Kamado from Demon Slayer as we embark on a 9-day journey to master image manipulation. Today, we learn the basics, just like Tanjiro trains relentlessly to hone his skills. Get ready to **l<mark>oad, display, and explore images</mark>** like never before!

  
I'd be glad to provide a comprehensive response that combines the strengths of previous responses, addresses feedback, and offers an exceptional step-by-step guide for Day 1 of your image processing series:

**Prerequisites:**

* **Libraries:** Use `pip` (the Python package installer) to install the follo[wing libraries:](https://www.python.org/)
    

```python
pip install pillow matplotlib imageio opencv-python
```

These libraries provide powerful tools for various image processing tasks:

* **Pillow (PIL Fork):** For basic [](https://www.python.org/)<mark>image loading, manipulating pixels, and saving results</mark>.
    
* **matplotlib:** For <mark>visualizing imag</mark>[<mark>e</mark>](https://bard.google.com/faq#coding)<mark>s using plots and figures.</mark>
    
* **imageio:** For <mark>handling diverse image formats</mark> and <mark>advanced loading/saving options</mark>.
    
* **OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library):** A comprehensive library for <mark>real-time computer vision</mark>, offering extensive <mark> image processin</mark>[<mark>g</mark>](https://www.python.org/) <mark> and manipulation capabilities</mark>.
    

### **Work Environment is** [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/) **you can visit and explore it open source and free!!!!!!**

**Key Concepts:**

**1\. Loading Images (Drawing Your Sword):**

* We'll use Python libraries like PIL, matplotlib, imageio, and OpenCV to access images, just like Tanjiro draws his Nichirin blade.
    
* Each library has its own style, but they all allow us to "summon" images into our environment.
    
* Choose an image you want to work with (e.g., `tanjiro.png`). Replace the path with your actual image location:
    

```python
#import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import imageio
import cv2

#you can use and of the following to open an image
# Using Pillow (PIL)
img_pillow = Image.open("path/to/tanjiro.png")

# Using matplotlib
img_matplotlib = plt.imread("path/to/tanjiro.png")

# Using imageio
img_imageio = imageio.imread("path/to/tanjiro.png")

# Using OpenCV (BGR by default)
img_opencv = cv2.imread("path/to/tanjiro.png", 1)  # 1 for color, 0 for grayscale
```

***<mark>Note:</mark> "You can use any to open/Read the image but for now I am using PIL to import !!!!!!"***

```python
#import necessary libraries
from PIL import Image

tanjiro_image = Image.open("path/to/tanjiro.png")
```

**2\. Displaying Images (Visualizing the Enemy):**

* Similar to how Tanjiro analyzes his opponents, we'll use libraries like matplotlib to "see" the images we loaded as on subplot graph.
    
* This helps us understand their content, colors, and structure.
    

**Example (matplotlib):**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.imshow(tanjiro_image)
plt.show()
```

**With OpenCV**

* <mark>By default, the image is saved in the BGR color space</mark>. As a result, the blue, green, and red color channels, respectively
    
* **OpenCV-Python** is a library of **Python** bindings designed to solve computer vision problems. cv2.imread() method <mark>loads an image from the specified file</mark>. If the image cannot be read (because of the missing file, improper permissions, or unsupported or invalid format) then this method returns an empty matrix.
    

```python
import cv2 as cv
import matplotlib.pyplot as pl
img = cv.imread('../input/digital-image/tanjiro.png',1)
pl.imshow(img)
```

**3\. Color Spaces (Adapting Your Form):**

* Images use different color spaces like RGB (red, green, blue) and BGR (blue, green, red).
    
* Think of it like Tanjiro adapting his fighting style to different demons. We'll learn how to convert between these spaces.
    

**Example (OpenCV):**

```python
import cv2

tanjiro_bgr = cv2.imread("path/to/tanjiro.png")
tanjiro_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(tanjiro_bgr, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB) #bgr to rgb
```

**4\. Image Dimensions (Assessing the Target):**

* Just like Tanjiro measures the size and shape of demons, we'll explore an image's width, height, and channels (color components),
    
* If image is grayscale channe is =0: (width , height, channel)
    
* This information helps us understand the image's structure and perform further analysis.
    

**Example (OpenCV):**

**Python**

```python
print("Image dimensions:", tanjiro_bgr.shape)
```

```plaintext
Image Dimension: (662, 892)
```

**Challenge:**

1. Experiment with different libraries and load multiple images. Display them side-by-side.
    
2. Try converting the image to grayscale (removing color information).
    
3. Extract specific information like pixel values or a particular color channel.
    

**Remember:** This is just the beginning! Like Tanjiro's training, mastering image processing takes practice. Keep exploring, experiment, and ask questions. Together, we'll become image manipulation masters!
